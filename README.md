# `tdinf`: time domain parameter estimation for gravitational-wave signals ðŸŒ€

### Installation
To make a virtual environment with everything you need to run `tdinf` you can use `uv`. To do this, clone the repository and run `uv sync` in its root folder. 

If you would like to install `tdinf` in an existing environment, you can instead clone the repository and run `pip install -e .` in its root folder. 

### Tutorials

There is a full tutorial for running `tdinf` on gravitational-wave signal GW190521 in the folder [here](https://github.com/simonajmiller/tdinf/tree/main/examples/GW190521), with options to run using `condor`, `slurm`, or in the commandline.
